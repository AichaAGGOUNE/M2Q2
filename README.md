Overview:
The M2Q2 (Movies in MongoDB Questionâ€”Query) dataset is designed for tasks related to query generation and answer extraction in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This dataset focuses on challenging questions that require generating complex Mongo queries to retrieve accurate answers without using spell-checking techniques.
M2Q2 is a dataset of 88,100 hand-annotated examples of questions and MQL (Mongo Query Language) queries. A transformer architecture-based model can be trained to automatically generate MongoDB queries from natural language questions.

Dataset Structure:
The M2Q2 dataset contains the following key fields:
- ID: Unique identifier for each record.
- Question: The original natural language question posed by a user.
- Generated_Query: The query generated by the model or a human expert to retrieve answers.

File Structure:
The dataset is provided in the following files:
- m2q2_train.csv: Training set containing question-query-answer triples.
- m2q2_valid.csv: Validation set used for fine-tuning and intermediate evaluation of model performance during training. 
- m2q2_test.csv: Test set used for evaluating model performance.

The M2Q2 dataset can be used for the following tasks:
1. Query Generation: Given a question, generate a structured query to retrieve relevant answers.
2. Answer Extraction: Extract accurate answers based on generated or predefined queries.
3. Evaluation Metrics: Common metrics include BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-score for query generation and accuracy and recall for answer extraction.
